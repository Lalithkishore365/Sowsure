## 🌾 Problem Statement

Farmers, especially small and marginal holders, often face difficulties in:

- Selecting appropriate crops based on soil, water, and season
- Planning crop rotation or intercropping strategies
- Accessing localized market trends or disease alerts
- Understanding government schemes or best practices
- Connecting with labor or local advisory resources

These gaps often lead to reduced yields, soil fatigue, and missed market opportunities.
